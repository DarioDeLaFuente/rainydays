The goal of these tasks is to create an end project. Ref: https://xd.adobe.com/view/6dc28e3e-0ede-46ef-97f2-6a695548e015-3891/

## Task1
1. Level 1 Process:
    1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
    2. Create an account with GitHub.
    3. Download GitHub Desktop which will help you keep track of updates to repositories.
    4. Create a repo on GitHub and clone it to your computer.
    5. Open the repo using VS Code.
    6. Update the repo by adding a file (any file will do).
    7. Commit your changes using GitHub Desktop and push to origin.
    8. Check on GitHub whether your repository has been updated.


## Task2
1. Level 2 Process:
    1. Register with Netlify and deploy a new site from Git.
    2. Before you deploy on Netlify, ensure you have a repo on your GitHub account with an index.html file in it. The file can just have some text in it 
    (just something to see that the page is being pulled across).
    3. Go to https://www.netlify.com/ and register. You might find it easiest to use your GitHub account.
    4. Click the button for ‘New site from Git’.
    5. Use Continuous Deployment to connect to GitHub and choose the repo you created in step 1.
    6. Deploy the site and click across to see your repo being deployed.
