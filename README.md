This is a simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

A detailed description of what the project entails and set out to do.
To put it into practice everything i have learned about HTML and CSS over this course.
I need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that i chose in Design 1.
The site needed to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. 
Certain functionality that requires JavaScript can be mimicked for now,for example a log in page links across from the ‘Sign in’ button.

Thisare some bullet points:

- The HTML i semantic and neat.
- CSS, I follow the DRY principle it makes it easy to read.
- The website i responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. 
- I use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. 
- I do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, The want to see that we can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
- The site is WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.
- Each page has a unique meta description, title, and h1.
- I do not use copied code in the submission. 
- All code submitted is written by me.
